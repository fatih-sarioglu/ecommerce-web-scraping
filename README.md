# E-Commerce Web Scraping

This is a small web scraping project that I did by myself.

**Task:** Navigating to the e-commerce site (trendyol.com) and simply scraping the data of laptops that have more than 100 reviews.

Below are the instructions to run the code:

### Attention:
This project is finished in June 2024 and it is successfully running. However, if the website used is altered after this date, the code may not work.

## 1. Prepare the environment:
Below are instructions to prepare the environment to run the project:

If you got this project from GitHub you first need to set up the environment:
1. Create a python environment.
2. Activate the environment.
3. Install the dependencies in *requirements.txt* file. You may also install the python version I used (3.12.2).
4. Download the chromedriver.exe and locate it to this directory.

## 2. Run the code:
All the code is in the *main.py*, so open it.

If you just want to test the code for a small run, you can do the following:
* Make the ``` testing = True``` and you can set ``` COMMENTS_UPPER_LIMIT ``` and ``` PRODUCTS_UPPER_LIMIT ``` to a small number and run the code.

To switch back to full version (as it is asked in the case study):
* Just make the ``` testing = False ``` and run the code.

### Attention
This project is done for educational purposes. No company or individual's data is shared or used for commercial purposes. All the scraped data is publicly available data.
